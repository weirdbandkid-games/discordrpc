# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/weirdbandkid/discordrpc.git`

`cd discordrpc`

***I suggest that you change the ID, images, and text in the `index.js` file***

`node .`

## Do you want an `.exe` file? 
DM me on Discord if you want one! 
Only thing I need to set it up is the file location.
